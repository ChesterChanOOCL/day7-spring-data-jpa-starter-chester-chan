Objective: 
Today, we focused on understanding the Controller-Service-Repository architecture 
and implemented unit tests for the employeeServiceTest and employControllerTest.
We created tests to ensure the functionality of our API and the interactions between the different layers of our application.

Reflective: Insightful

Interpretive: We surely  gained a deeper understanding of how to structure our code using the Controller-Service-Repository pattern 
and the significance of unit testing in maintaining code quality. 
This knowledge is crucial for building scalable and maintainable applications, and for ensuring that our code works as expected through rigorous testing.

Decisional: For me, I will surely continue to refine our tests, explore more advanced testing techniques,
and apply this architecture to other parts of our application. I will consider using SpringBoot for desired dev framework in the furture as well.
